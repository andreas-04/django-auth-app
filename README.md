This is a basic django user authentication app. It uses the django-rest framework to create different endpoints used for user auth, register, login and logout. 
This authenticatin method uses token based session authentication. When a user is succesfully logged a session token is generated.

I used a custom user model, for more [information](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/customizing/#extending-user).

This is a good starting point if you need a basic user authentication system in your application and dont want to build it from the ground up.

Happy Hacking!
